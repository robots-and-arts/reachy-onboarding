## 🚀 Get Started

It is imperative that all the students follow a systematic start-up and wind-down procedure for accessing the bot by themselves, **after** being trained by the CA to use the bot.
* The bot will be placed inside **Room ** beside the kitchen in SRC. Please ensure to take the bot from the room, and place it back there after using it.
* The bot is placed in a cardboard box with 1) power adapter and 2) USB connector. Make sure to place both of these cables back into the box after usage.
* For usage, **please do not take the bot outside of the SRC**. Students are required to come to the SRC to work on the Reachy, and regardless of how portable the bot seems, we need it to be accessible to all students at all times. You are free to use any of the open spaces to tinker with the bot.

Make sure you carry out the following steps in order - ensure that the installation and quickstart guide were executed error free.

* **[Installation](installation.md)**: Set up your computer to work with the Reachy Mini
* **[Quickstart Guide](quickstart.md)**: Run your first behavior on the bot.
* **[Python SDK](/StarterCode)**:  Take a look at the files in the "StarterCode" folder to explore basic bot applications such as move, look, play.
* **[AI Integrations](https://github.com/pollen-robotics/reachy_mini/blob/develop/docs/SDK/integration.md)**: Refer this official documentation to have a detailed look on how to connect LLMs, build Apps, and publish to Hugging Face.
* **[Core Concepts](core-concept.md)**: Architecture, coordinate systems, and safety limits.
